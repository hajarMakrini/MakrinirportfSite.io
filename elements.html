									<h1>My AlX <br />
									JOURNEY...</h1>
								</header>

								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/alximage.png" alt="" /></span>

								<h2>The Beginning..</h2>

									<p>My journey with ALX Africa began on August 10, 2023. My goal was clear: to become a proficient software engineering student and enhance my computer science skills. At first, the thought of an eight-month program seemed daunting, but as the days passed, tackling task after task, I found myself growing and adapting to the challenges.
										<br>
										<h2>how was my journey & challenges:</h2>
										To be honest, the journey wasn’t easy.
										 With each deadline and new project, self-doubt and stress often crept in,
										  making me question my ability to complete the program.
										   Juggling my studies at another faculty (academic studies) added to the 
										   challenge, creating a whirlwind of anxiety and fear of failure.
										    But amidst the struggles, the motivating words from the ALX team 
											— “Do hard things!” — and their unwavering support inspired me to
											 push through</p>

												<h2>How Did Deferring My ALX Africa Cohort Help Me Succeed?</h2>
												<p>During my journey with ALX Africa, I faced a challenging period where
													 I had to defer to another cohort. As deadlines approached, I found 
													 myself overwhelmed with studies for exams in another field, leaving
													  me with little time to focus on my ALX projects. The deadlines passed, 
													  and the review process was closed. At first, I was terrified of the idea of withdrawing,
													   as I didn't want to give up on what I had started. However, I remembered why I embarked
													    on this journey in the first place, and I realized that deferring was the only solution.
														<br> <br>
													I deferred from cohort 19 to cohort 21, and in that time, I repeated all the projects
													 during the last month. In hindsight, this was the best decision I could have made. 
													 The deferment gave me a renewed sense of energy and determination to complete what
													  I had started. I was able to finish strong, achieving a good score in the final,
													   and I am proud of what I accomplished. So, if you ever find yourself in the same 
													   position, don't be afraid to start something again.</p>
												<figure>
													<h2>Determination and Perseverance: Keys to Success!</h2>
											<p>	This program taught me that perseverance, grit, and an unwavering commitment to my dreams are essential. By month eight, achieving a score above 100%—something that seemed impossible before my deferment—reinforced the belief that with determination and hard work, nothing is impossible.
											<br>
											<h2>The Power of Community and Friendship on My Journey</h2>
											Throughout this journey, I wasn’t alone. I made friends from various cities in 
											Morocco and different 
											countries across Africa. Despite coming from different cohorts, we all shared
											 the
											same goal: to complete what we started. This sense of community and support was
											 invaluable</p>

								<p> The unique and rich community of ALX, supported by platforms 
									like Discord, Slack, and WhatsApp, fosters a collaborative and supportive environment. 
									Preceding cohorts help the newcomers, and various events and meetings on Zoom, YouTube
									, and Discord make us feel like one big family, despite the physical distance.</p>

										<h2>Project</h2>
										<p>
											As part of my journey with ALX Africa,my final project was a 3D maze game to understand game development.
											  The purpose of this project was to explore the intricate process of creating 
											  a game and to develop professional skills in this exciting field. 
											  I chose to create a 3D maze game using SDL2 and raycasting.
												This project allowed me to delve into the basic concepts and techniques 
												required
												 to transform a simple 2D map into an immersive 3D world that players can explore.
												 <br>
												  Through this experience, I gained valuable insights into the mechanics of game
												   development and honed my technical skills. If you want to check more details about it,

												<h2>how much I recommend the program?</h2>
									<p>I highly recommend ALX’s program to anyone considering it. Unlike other programs where you watch videos and work in isolation, ALX offers a classroom-like environment with set deadlines. It may seem tough at first, but this program isn’t for the faint-hearted — it’s for those with passion and resilience. Even if you don’t have these qualities at first, you can build them with hard work and perseverance.
									</p> 
									<p>Now, even after completing the initial program,
 										my journey is far from over.
										 I am entering the specialization phase,
										  where I will delve deeper into advanced topics and further refine my skills.
										   This next step promises to be just as challenging and rewarding, 
										   pushing me to new heights in my career <strong>This journey is just the beginning, 
										   and I’m excited to see where it takes me next..  </strong>
